# Feynman's Gambit Architecture

**Feynman's Gambit** is an ambitious chess platform that integrates modern technologies to deliver high-performance chess game interactions, real-time analytics, and an engaging user experience. The platform will leverage **Deno 2**, **Zig**, **Rust**, and **Go**, each playing a distinct role within the system, to create a scalable, efficient, and responsive system architecture.

## Objective

The objective is to create a scalable, performant, and modular chess platform that can handle real-time game logic, user interactions, game state management, data analytics, and provide a rich, dynamic user experience. The platform will use four different technologies, each specialised for different components of the system:

- **Deno 2**: Frontend, User Interface, WebSocket Communication
- **Zig**: Chess Engine, Game Logic, Board State
- **Rust**: Backend, API Management, Database Interaction
- **Go**: Data Analytics, Real-Time Metrics, and Player Statistics

## Architecture Overview

### 1. **Frontend (Deno 2)**
- **Role**: Client-side interaction, WebSockets, UI rendering.
- **Technologies**: Deno 2 (Frontend framework)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **User Interface**: Deno 2 will handle the entire UI, rendering the chessboard, game state, player interactions (move/undo), and notifications.
  - **Real-Time Communication**: Deno 2 will handle WebSocket connections to communicate with the Rust backend for real-time game updates.
  - **Game State Rendering**: It will display updated game states, including moves, in real time.
  - **Player Interaction**: Capture user inputs (move pieces, make decisions) and send them to the backend for processing.

### 2. **Chess Engine & Game Logic (Zig)**
- **Role**: Game logic, chess rules, board state management, and move validation.
- **Technologies**: Zig (Chess engine implementation)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Chess Engine**: Zig will implement the core chess logic, including move generation, validation, and determining game outcomes (checkmate, stalemate, etc.).
  - **Game State Management**: Zig will maintain the game state (e.g., board positions, player turns) and ensure consistency with chess rules.
  - **AI (Optional)**: If implementing a computer opponent, Zig will handle the chess engine's AI, responding to player moves.

### 3. **Backend (Rust)**
- **Role**: Backend logic, interfacing with the Zig chess engine, database management, and API handling.
- **Technologies**: Rust (General backend)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Game State API**: Rust will provide the API layer that manages game sessions, fetching game state, validating moves, and sending results to the frontend.
  - **Communication with Zig**: Rust will interface with the Zig chess engine to validate and process moves, as well as manage game state transitions.
  - **Player Management**: Rust will handle player profiles, login sessions, authentication, and game history.
  - **Database Interaction**: Rust will connect to and manage the database, storing player data, game history, and session details.
  - **Game Logic Flow**: Rust will manage the overall game flow, interacting with Zig for move validation and ensuring proper game progression.

### 4. **External Data Analysis Tool (Go)**
- **Role**: Data analysis, real-time metrics, player analytics.
- **Technologies**: Go (Data analysis, metrics processing)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Real-Time Metrics**: Go will track player performance, average game duration, win/loss ratios, and other key statistics.
  - **Data Processing**: Go will fetch game data from the database or API, perform analytics, and generate insights.
  - **Player Analytics**: Track player statistics, win streaks, and other analytics.
  - **External Service**: Go will operate as a separate service that asynchronously handles long-running data tasks.
  - **Reporting & Dashboards**: Go can generate and store reports, performance trends, and analytics for use by both players and administrators.

## Communication Flow

The following is the communication flow between the components:

1. **Deno 2 (Frontend)**:
   - Sends **WebSocket requests** to the **Rust backend** for game interactions (starting games, making moves, updating game state).
   
2. **Rust (Backend)**:
   - Interacts with **Zig** to validate moves and update game states.
   - Handles the overall flow of the game and ensures that the game is proceeding correctly.
   - Communicates with the **database** to store player information, game history, and session data.

3. **Zig (Chess Engine)**:
   - Handles the core **game logic** (move validation, board state updates, AI, etc.).
   - Sends move validation responses and updated game states back to Rust.

4. **Go (External Data Analysis)**:
   - Retrieves game data from the **Rust API** or **database**.
   - Processes **real-time metrics**, tracks player performance, and generates reports.
   - Stores aggregated statistics for long-term analysis.
